# AirBnB clone with React

## Description

This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because I will use what I  build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration...

##  To run this project

1. Clone this repository
2. Install all dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Run the server:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
